[{"role": "user", "message": "Start"}, {"role": "assistant", "message": "Alright, let's start by planning our process. Here is a tentative plan:\n\n1. Ask the user which file he/she wants to use among `/home/azureuser/data/leeds_dna_v5.csv` and `/home/azureuser/data/dudley.csv`.\n2. Load the chosen file and examine the first few rows to understand what data we're working with.\n3. Perform initial data exploration to identify the data types and the column which can be turned into the 'dna' column.\n4. Confirm our initial assumptions about the data from the user.\n5. Handle missing values, either by imputing them or removing rows with missing values based on the user's preference.\n6. Rename/create the 'dna' column based on the column identified in step 3 and the user's confirmation.\n7. If there's a datetime column, handle it and perform datetime split on train and test data. Otherwise, split the data into training and testing sets as per user preference.\n8. Split the target column ('dna') into y_test and y_train.\n9. Prepare the rest of the data for machine learning. This involves:\n    * Identifying and confirming data types\n    * Doing feature engineering\n    * Encoding categorical columns using a Helmert Encoder and scaling numerical columns using a MinMax Scaler.\n10. Ask for feedback from the user after every major step and adjust our process based on feedback.\n11. Save the preprocessed data with the user's consent.\n\nBy following this plan, we will transform the original dataset into a format ready for TensorFlow neural network modelling.
