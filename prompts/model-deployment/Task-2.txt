Create a transformation.py file, rewrite if already exists. Refer transform.py.
this will have a function called transform_data which accepts a model input values (data) as input
transforms it such that it can fed into the model, and returns the transformed values.
write only the function as it will be called upon externally.
Save transformation.py to '/mnt/ssd/deployment'
