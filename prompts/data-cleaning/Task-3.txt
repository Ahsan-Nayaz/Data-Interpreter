Check each column of the data frame for missing values and report the proportion of missing values to the user.
Suggest that the user drops any columns found to have 100% missing values.

Assumptions:
    Columns with a 100% missing values are irrelevant.

Consideration:
    Null values might carry information; blindly dropping columns with smaller proportions of missing values can lead to loss of meaningful data.
