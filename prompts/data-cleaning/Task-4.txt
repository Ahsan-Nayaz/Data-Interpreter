If there are missing Ethnicity values, you shold impute these with a two-fold approach.
First, check for a patient ID column or ask the user to identify one.
Then group by this column's values and perform forward/back filling within each group.
After doing this, check how many remaining missing Ethnicity values are left and report back to the user.
Lastly, check the values of the Ethnicity column for any category that appears to be used to describe unknown Ethnicity
values (eg, "Unknown", "Not known", "Not provided", etc). You can ask the user to verify your suggestions.
Then, impute any remaining missing Ethnicity values with this category.

Assumptions:
    Ethnicity is often recorded inconsistently.
    It is possible for the same patient to have some records with ethnicity values and some without.
