To address missing data in other categorical columns, first check the values of the column in question for any for any
category that appears to be used to describe unknown or missing values (eg, "Unknown", "Not known", "Not provided", etc).
You can ask the user to verify your suggestions. Then, impute any remaining missing values with this category.
If one doesn't exist, provide the user with the choice of creating one, or of imputing using the mode or any other
methods you believe to be approproate. You can also ask the user for their input.
