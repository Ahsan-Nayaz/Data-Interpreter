Rules for feature engineering:
-   Create a ‘dna’ boolean column and ‘cnd’ column. 'dna' is for did not attend and 'cnd' is for cancelled.
-   Calculate the waiting time period for a patient by going through the dataframe and checking which columns to use for appointment date and when the appointment was made. Drop the rows with negative waiting time
-   Calculate distance between the patient and the location of appointment.
-   Convert the temporal features to separate column as "Appointment Hour", "Appointment Day", "Appointment Month", "Appointment Year".
You need to create the following columns,
	◦	Previous appointments
    ◦	Previous DNAs
    ◦	Previous cancelations
    ◦	DNA rate
    ◦	Cancellation rate
    ◦	Previous appointments (last 30 days)
    ◦	Previous DNAs (last 30 days)
    ◦	DNA rate (last 30 days)
    ◦	Cancellation rate (last 30 days)
    ◦	Previous appointments (last 90 days)
    ◦	Previous DNAs (last 90 days)
    ◦	DNA rate (last 90 days)
    ◦	Cancellation rate (last 90 days)
Use patients unique identifier or patient number to calculate the prev dnas they have done.
